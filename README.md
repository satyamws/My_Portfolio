# 🍳 Kitchen Cook – VR Cooking Experience  

## 🧾 Project Details
- **Genre:** Simulation / Casual VR
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Platform:** PCVR (Oculus, HTC Vive)
- **Type:** Internship Project
- **Development Period:** Jan–Feb 2019

## 🎮 Overview  
*Kitchen Cook* is my first VR game, designed as an immersive and interactive cooking experience. The player starts in the center of a fully-equipped kitchen and is tasked with preparing a vegetable dish by following a sequence of realistic cooking steps.

## 🧑‍🍳 Gameplay Flow  
- 📋 **Instructions** are displayed on a UI canvas mounted on the kitchen wall.  
- 🧊 The player opens the **fridge** to collect ingredients: carrot, onion, tomato, brinjal, etc.  
- 🪵 Vegetables are placed on a **wooden slab**, and the player uses a **knife** to cut them into pieces.  
- 🥘 The chopped vegetables are added to a **saucepan** on the stove.  
- 🔥 The player turns the **gas knob 360°** to ignite the flame and start cooking.  
- 🧂 Next, the player adds **spices** by:
  - Grabbing a spice bottle from the cupboard
  - Rotating the cap more than 90° clockwise
  - Pouring using the **thumbstick** on the VR controller  
- ⏱️ After **100 seconds**, the food is transformed from raw to cooked.  
- 🍽️ Finally, the player picks up a **plate**, serves the food, and completes the dish.

## 🔧 Key Features  
- Natural VR interactions: grabbing, cutting, rotating, and pouring  
- Motion controller-based input  
- State-based cooking progression (raw → cooked)  
- Visual guidance using in-game UI

# 🚚 Warehousing – VR Logistics Simulation  
**Type:** Professional Project (Small Contributor)  
**Duration:** 2 months  
**Engine:** Unity  
**Platform:** PCVR  
**Genre:** Driving / Simulation / VR  
**Players:** Single-player  

## 🧾 Project Summary  
*Warehousing* is a VR simulation game focused on the operation of industrial machines commonly used in logistics environments, such as forklifts and order pickers. It was designed to train or familiarize users with realistic machine handling within warehouse settings.

I contributed to this project during a 4-month internship, with around 2 months dedicated specifically to this title. My role was focused on gameplay systems and UX design as a small part of a larger team.

## 🛠️ My Contributions  
- Assisted in designing and prototyping the **custom controller** and **input system** for forklift and order picker vehicles.  
- Supported implementation of core **gameplay mechanics** using Unity3D.  
- Helped design early versions of the **UI/UX onboarding flow** to guide new players.  
- Contributed to level design and **progression systems**, introducing gameplay challenges across multiple warehouse scenarios.
