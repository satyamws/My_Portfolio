# 🍳 Kitchen Cook – VR Cooking Experience  
**Developed:** Jan–Feb 2019  
**Platform:** Virtual Reality (Unity, C#)  




## 🎮 Overview  
*Kitchen Cook* is my first VR game, designed as an immersive and interactive cooking experience. The player starts in the center of a fully-equipped kitchen and is tasked with preparing a vegetable dish by following a sequence of realistic cooking steps.

## 🧑‍🍳 Gameplay Flow  
- 📋 **Instructions** are displayed on a UI canvas mounted on the kitchen wall.  
- 🧊 The player opens the **fridge** to collect ingredients: carrot, onion, tomato, brinjal, etc.  
- 🪵 Vegetables are placed on a **wooden slab**, and the player uses a **knife** to cut them into pieces.  
- 🥘 The chopped vegetables are added to a **saucepan** on the stove.  
- 🔥 The player turns the **gas knob 360°** to ignite the flame and start cooking.  
- 🧂 Next, the player adds **spices** by:
  - Grabbing a spice bottle from the cupboard
  - Rotating the cap more than 90° clockwise
  - Pouring using the **thumbstick** on the VR controller  
- ⏱️ After **100 seconds**, the food is transformed from raw to cooked.  
- 🍽️ Finally, the player picks up a **plate**, serves the food, and completes the dish.

## 🔧 Key Features  
- Natural VR interactions: grabbing, cutting, rotating, and pouring  
- Motion controller-based input  
- State-based cooking progression (raw → cooked)  
- Visual guidance using in-game UI
