- **Genre:** Simulation / Casual VR
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Platform:** PCVR (Oculus, HTC Vive)
- **Type:** Internship Project
- **Development Period:** Jan–Feb 2019

## 🎮 Overview  
*Kitchen Cook* is my first VR game, designed as an immersive and interactive cooking experience. The player starts in the center of a fully-equipped kitchen and is tasked with preparing a vegetable dish by following a sequence of realistic cooking steps.

## 🧑‍🍳 Gameplay Flow  
- 📋 **Instructions** are displayed on a UI canvas mounted on the kitchen wall.  
- 🧊 The player opens the **fridge** to collect ingredients: carrot, onion, tomato, brinjal, etc.  
- 🪵 Vegetables are placed on a **wooden slab**, and the player uses a **knife** to cut them into pieces.  
- 🥘 The chopped vegetables are added to a **saucepan** on the stove.  
- 🔥 The player turns the **gas knob 360°** to ignite the flame and start cooking.  
- 🧂 Next, the player adds **spices** by:
  - Grabbing a spice bottle from the cupboard
  - Rotating the cap more than 90° clockwise
  - Pouring using the **thumbstick** on the VR controller  
- ⏱️ After **100 seconds**, the food is transformed from raw to cooked.  
- 🍽️ Finally, the player picks up a **plate**, serves the food, and completes the dish.

## 🔧 Key Features  
- Natural VR interactions: grabbing, cutting, rotating, and pouring  
- Motion controller-based input  
- State-based cooking progression (raw → cooked)  
- Visual guidance using in-game UI

# 🧍‍♂️ Ergo – Ergonomics Assessment & Health Registration App

**Type:** Professional Project (Sole Developer)  
**Duration:** ~1 year  
**Platform:** Android/iOS  
**Engine:** Unity  
**Domain:** Occupational Health / Ergonomics  

## 🧾 Project Summary  
*Ergo* is a health and ergonomics assessment application developed for warehouse environments. The tool enables workers to register physical discomfort and input job-specific details to evaluate the risk of injury. The goal is to assist safety teams in recommending targeted treatments or ergonomic interventions based on real-time user feedback.

As the sole developer, I was responsible for the complete lifecycle of the app—from UX design to implementation, logic, and UI polish.

## 👤 Key Features & Workflow  

1. **User Registration**  
   - Workers enter personal details (e.g., name, department).

2. **Pain Identification**  
   - Users select the **affected body area**.  
   - Indicate the **severity level**: Low, Medium, or High.

3. **Load & Handling Info**  
   - Input job-specific physical data:
     - Type of load
     - Weight
     - Lifting/carrying angle
     - Body rotation
     - Carrying method

4. **Risk Scoring & Output**  
   - The app calculates a **risk score** based on ergonomic assessment logic.  
   - Displays suggested **intervention or treatment path** for each case.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities  
- Solely designed and developed the app using **Unity** and C#.  
- Built intuitive UI for both **mouse and touchscreen input**.  
- Designed backend logic to map pain levels and lifting data to ergonomic risk scores.  
- Worked directly with the health & safety team to align features with real-world ergonomic standards.  
- Optimized the app for deployment on warehouse **kiosks and tablets**.

# 👋 Slap App Game – Corporate Stress-Relief Mobile App

**Type:** Professional Project (Sole Developer)  
**Platform:** Android & iOS  
**Engine:** Unity  
**Genre:** Humor / Casual / Corporate Fun  
**Duration:** ~1.5 months  

## 🧾 Project Summary  
*Slap App Game* is a lighthearted, mobile-friendly app created for corporate teams to anonymously vent workplace frustration in a humorous way. The app allows users to register fictionalized versions of colleagues or former coworkers, log incidents, and then interact with a customized avatar in a playful slap animation.

I developed this app end-to-end during my internship, handling everything from UI/UX to backend integration and cross-platform deployment.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Flow  

1. **User & Target Registration**  
   - The player enters the name of a colleague or ex-colleague.  
   - Logs an **incident description** and **approximate time period**.

2. **Avatar Creation**  
   - Users customize a cartoon-style **avatar** representing the person (abuser).  
   - Features include face, hairstyle, clothing, etc.

3. **Slap Interaction**  
   - On the final screen, the user **taps the avatar’s face** to "slap" them.  
   - A humorous animation and sound effect play as feedback.

4. **Persistent Dashboard**  
   - The app saves abuser data (privately) to a **local/remote backend**.  
   - Returning users can **slap existing avatars** again without recreating them.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities  
- Full development of the app using **Unity** for cross-platform support (iOS & Android).  
- Designed the **avatar creation system**, including face and body part customization.  
- Built out the **incident logging system** and **dashboard** to manage multiple entries.  
- Integrated backend logic to persist user-submitted avatar data.  
- Developed animation and sound feedback for slap interactions.  
- Ensured a smooth and friendly **UI/UX** experience for non-gamers in a corporate environment.
